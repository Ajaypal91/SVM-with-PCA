# SVM-with-PCA
This repository contains a basic example of how to use SVM and PCA of scikit library of the python

DATASET USED: BRAF dataset 

The example runs SVM and then runs PCA untill the accuracy is not lesser than the given tolerance level.

A plot of loading factor which shows the variance of each dimensions is plotted and an elbow plot is drawn to show the number
of features that are accounted in each case.
